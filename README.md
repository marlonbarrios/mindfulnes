I teach online and onsite mindfulness meditation sessions to artists, dancers, creative technologists and blockchain enthusiasts. We explore the potency of embodied awareness, ‘bodyfulness’ as a reframing of the four foundations of Mindfulness (Satipathana) as presented by early buddhism. I experiment with horizontal formats of facilitation and  intersect the practice of "Sati" with  contemporary practices influenced by embodied cognition and somatics. The sessions are  structired with  guided mindfulness practice, somatic movement awareness ufolding into a council/dialogue practice. I have specialized in  embodied presence in online environments. Important aspects of the role of hope, future thinking and burnout are explored.
