# Mindfulness Meditation (SATI)
## Classes, workshops, facilitation, mini-retreats, one on one consulting

I offer online and IRL mindfulness meditation sessions to artists, dancers, creative technologists, and blockchain enthusiasts. During these sessions, we will delve into the power of embodied awareness, also known as "bodyfulness." We will reinterpret the four foundations of mindfulness from early Buddhism, combining contemporary practices influenced by embodied cognition and somatics with the practice of "Sati."

The sessions are structured with guided mindfulness practice, somatic movement awareness, and a council/dialogue practice. I have been researching and developing embodied presence practices for online environments and teaching mindfulness from a fully embodied perspective.

I host an ongoing mindfulness practice group every Wednesday at 6pm CET/12pm EST, supported by Kernel. If you're interested, you can email marlon@dance-tech.net for the link. I also offer online one-on-one consultations by appointment.

As a certified Vipassana/Mindfulness Meditation Teacher by Spirit Rock Meditation Center in the US, I bring over two decades of experience and training to my teachings. I started my journey with Zen studies and practice in 1998 at the Village Zendo in NYC with Enkio O'Hara and later deepened my understanding of Vipassana at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA. I lived and worked at Insight Meditation Society from 2016 to 2021, and I have studies under the mentorship of Stephen Barchelor since 2015.

With a strong background in somatics and movement art practices, as well as a trauma-sensitive approach and on complexity theory, therefore I offer a unique perspective as a meditation teacher.

As a certified meditation teacher, I have a deep appreciation for the Buddha and his teachings. It's said that he liked to be represented by footprints, but I imagine he would have a good laugh and enjoy these AI-generated depictions of him. From a Buddha inspired by the work of Basquiat and Haring to those depicted in Blade Runner and Jim Henson, these representations may be empty, but they highlight the enduring influence of the Buddha and his teachings.
