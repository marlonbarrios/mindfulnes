I offer online and in-person mindfulness meditation sessions tailored to artists, dancers, creative technologists, and blockchain enthusiasts. During these sessions, we explore the power of embodied awareness, also known as "bodyfulness," by reinterpreting the four foundations of mindfulness from early Buddhism. I combine contemporary practices influenced by embodied cognition and somatics with the practice of "Sati" to offer a fully embodied perspective on mindfulness.

Each session includes guided mindfulness practice, somatic movement awareness, and a council/dialogue practice. I have researched and developed embodied presence practices for online environments, enabling me to teach mindfulness from a fully embodied perspective.

I host a weekly mindfulness practice group every Wednesday at 6pm CET/12pm EST, supported by Kernel. If you're interested, please email me at marlon@dance-tech.net for the link. Additionally, I offer one-on-one online consultations by appointment.

As a certified Vipassana/Mindfulness Meditation Teacher by Spirit Rock Meditation Center in the US, I bring over two decades of experience and training to my teachings. My journey started with Zen studies and practice in 1998 at the Village Zendo in NYC, and I later deepened my understanding of Vipassana at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA. From 2016 to 2021, I lived and worked at Insight Meditation Society and studied under the mentorship of Stephen Barchelor since 2015.

With a strong background in somatics and movement art practices, as well as a trauma-sensitive approach and complexity theory, I offer a unique perspective as a meditation teacher. Additionally, I am an EmbodyogaÂ® 200 Hour Registered Yoga Teacher and a meditation teacher in residence at Lake Sudios Berlin, as well as a guide of the meditation guild in Kernel.

Finally, I am the creator and developer of Sati-AI, an AI-driven Buddhist meditation assistant capable of answering all inquiries related to mindfulness meditation and early Buddhist concepts and philosophies. With its multilingual capabilities, Sati-AI provides guidance in a range of languages, enabling users to receive support for their meditation practices in their preferred language. Simply pose any question related to mindfulness and early Buddhism to access its insightful and dependable advice, anytime and anywhere.

As a certified meditation teacher, I have a deep appreciation for the Buddha and his teachings. It's said that he liked to be represented by footprints, but I imagine he would have a good laugh and enjoy these AI-generated depictions of him. From a Buddha inspired by the work of Basquiat and Haring to those depicted in Blade Runner and Jim Henson, these representations may be empty, but they highlight the enduring influence of the Buddha and his teachings.
